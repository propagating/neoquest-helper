The script also places two buttons in stats: Autobattle (on/off) and Trainer (on/off)
Note: these functions enable automatic page loads, which is against neopets rules.
Autobattle will, when in battle:
  'do nothing' when stunned;
  absorb whenever possible;
  spirit of growth when possible and missing at least 60 life;
  use whichever potion you have the most of when at or below half health;
  attack, of course, otherwise;
  skip start and end battle pages, except on a "new level" page.
Trainer will:
  move left and right until you tell it to stop;
  switch to hunting when turned on;
  switch to sneaking when turned off.
