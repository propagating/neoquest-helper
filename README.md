The script also places two buttons in stats: Autobattle (on/off) and Trainer (on/off)  
Note: these functions enable automatic page loads, which is against neopets rules.  

Autobattle will (in battle):  
 - 'do nothing' when stunned;  
 - absorb whenever possible;  
 - spirit of growth when possible and missing at least 60 life;  
 - use whichever potion you have the most of when at or below half health;  
 - attack, of course, otherwise;  
 - skip start and end battle pages, except on a "new level" page.  

Trainer will (not in battle):  
 - move left and right until termination;  
 - switch to hunting and ask what level to train to when turned on;  
 - turn off when level specified is reached;
 - switch to sneaking when turned off.
